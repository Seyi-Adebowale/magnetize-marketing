Whether you’re a small business owner, a blogger, or a marketing professional, knowing the fundamentals of SEO can help you improve your website’s visibility in search engine results and attract more organic traffic.

        <h4>What is SEO?</h4>
        <p>
          SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of optimizing your website to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) for relevant keywords and phrases. The goal of SEO is to increase your website’s visibility and attract more organic (non-paid) traffic from search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.
        </p>

        <h4>Why is SEO Important?</h4>
        <p>
          SEO is important because it helps your website get found by people who are actively searching for information, products, or services related to your business. By appearing higher in search results, you can increase your website’s visibility, drive more traffic, and ultimately, grow your online presence and business.
        </p>

          <li><strong>On-Page Optimization:</strong> Optimize individual pages of your website, including meta tags (title tags, meta descriptions), headings, and content for target keywords.</li>
          <li><strong>Off-Page Optimization:</strong> Build quality backlinks from other websites, manage your online reputation, and engage on social media platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical SEO:</strong> Improve crawlability, site speed, fix crawl errors, and use structured data markup.</li>
