        <p>
          As AI-driven platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google‚Äôs Search Generative Experience (SGE) reshape the digital landscape, marketers must adapt their strategies to ensure visibility across both traditional search engines (SEO) and generative search engines (GSO).
        </p>

        <h4>üîç What Is Generative Search Optimization (GSO)?</h4>
        <p>
          Generative Search Optimization (GSO), also known as Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), focuses on enhancing content to be effectively interpreted and featured by AI-driven platforms. Unlike traditional SEO, which targets keyword rankings, GSO aims to ensure content is structured and authoritative enough to be included in AI-generated responses.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Differences Between SEO and GSO</h4>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Aspect</th>
              <th>SEO Focus</th>
              <th>GSO Focus</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Primary Goal</td>
              <td>Rank in search engine results pages (SERPs)</td>
              <td>Be featured in AI-generated responses</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Content Structure</td>
              <td>Keyword optimization, meta tags</td>
              <td>Clear headings, concise answers, structured data</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Authority Signals</td>
              <td>Backlinks, domain authority</td>
              <td>Mentions in credible sources, E-E-A-T principles</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>User Engagement</td>
              <td>Click-through rates, dwell time</td>
              <td>Content relevance and clarity for AI interpretation</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h4>Best Practices for Optimizing SEO and GSO</h4>

        </ul>

        <h4>Measuring Success in GSO</h4>
        <p>

        </p>
